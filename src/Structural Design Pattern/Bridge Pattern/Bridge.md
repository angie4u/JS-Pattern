# What is Bridge Pattern?

by Wiki...
The bridge pat is a design pattern used in software engineering that is meant to **decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently**, introduced by the Gang of Four. The bridge uses encapsulation, aggregation, and can use inheritance to separate responsibilities into different classes.

This can prevent 'Cartesian Product' complexity
